# File Upload Component (Crystalliser UI)

This code snippet is part of a file upload feature for the embedded UI of Photocentric's crystalliser 3D printer.

It allows users to upload a single file either via drag-and-drop or by selecting a file manually. The component ensures that only one file is uploaded at a time and displays error messages when needed. Upload progress is shown using modals, and the UI prevents uploading when chosen to be disabled.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop support
- Manual file selection
- File validation (single file only)
- Upload status modals (loading, error handling)
- Integration-ready with Angular services

## Technologies

- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML / SCSS
